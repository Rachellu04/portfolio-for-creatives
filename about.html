        <p>
          “It was so interesting to see other classmates’ websites full of their
          personalities!” —
          <a href="https://solyoon.me/" target="_blank">Sol Yoon</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          “It was so cool to code a full website with my personal branding. Be
          brave! Try something new, bold, and fun! I learned so much by
          committing to my design choices. It builds my confidence to know I can
          pick up a complex skill like coding and make it match my design
          style.” —

          “A highlight of this course was planning out and implementing fun,
          quirky Easter eggs for my website.” —
          <a href="https://emmado.com/" target="_blank">Emma Do</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          “Highlights of this course were the final website presentation. It was
          great watching everyone’s site coming together and getting feedback.
          For me, the highlight was all the customization I did on my website
          and coding many parts from scratch. This class was the most useful for
          me out of all the IDEA classes, as I now have an official site to show
          everyone.” —

        <p>
          “Coding, for me, is super fun, and I do plan on delving into it more
          in the next year to really polish up my website. Starting out with a
          template for our coded website was helpful to refresh my mind on
          coding. I like that we were able to get a lot of independent working
          time to curate our own website. I found it helpful going through past
          examples from other grads on how they set up their website, which I
          found to be influential for my own website. I also loved seeing
          everyone’s websites during presentation day, and it gave me ideas on
          how to improve mine.” —

          “Some of my highlights of this course were seeing everyone’s websites
          at the end of the course and being able to code again. I enjoyed
          getting to do something that’s different from our usual design courses
          and being able to shut off my brain and focus on the code. It’s also
          satisfying to see all of your work come together at the end.” —
